# SpellSword
2D rogue like game made in the Love2D framework.
Design points (may change):
- Doom inspired levels.
- Difficulties range from easy with some monsters, medium with 2x monsters compared to easy, and hard with 3x monsters.
- Can pick to start with lives or to not have lives at all. On death, player resets back to start of level as if nothing happened (all their gear is restored), if they have no lives on death then it's game over.
- Player can attack with left and right mouse button, i.e. dual wield. They can choose to slot a melee weapon or staff in either mouse button/hand. If this can't be achieved, just stick with melee on left and staff on right. Holding down left and right buttons offers a slower, more powerful attack.
